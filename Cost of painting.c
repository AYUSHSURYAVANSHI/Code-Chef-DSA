//Solution as follows

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int s = 14 ;
  int area = s * s ;
  int cost = area * 7 ;
  printf("%d \n", area );   //Area and cost have to be output on separate lines
  printf("%d", cost );      //'$' has to be printed after cost without any space
  printf("$"); 
  return 0;
}
